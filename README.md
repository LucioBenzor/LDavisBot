Lydia Davis is a wonderful writer whose prose's concision and brevity is well-suited to twitter.
This bot is powered by tweepy and a simple .txt file maintained by me with selections of Mrs. Davis's prose. 

Mostly known for her collections of very short stories, her *Collected Works* can be used, as someone said, to jack a car and change a tire -- there's no shortage of material. Passages are from the *Collected Works* and *Can't And Won't*.
